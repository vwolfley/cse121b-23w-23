# Week 7: What Next?

## Assessing Online Sources

Throughout this course, you've been exposed to multiple sources of information about the language. This week, you are asked to spend about three hours pondering and reasoning about the sources of information you've experienced.

Your pondering and reasoning should include thinking about these types of things.

- What, do you think, made the difference between a good source and one that wasn't so good? 
- Have you learned to tell reputable sources from iffy ones? 
- How have you begun to differentiate between reputable and iffy sources?
  
If, for example, you were going to answer someone's coding question about this language, what should you do to be a reputable source? What online sources have you used and in what order would you rank them for quality and usability?

While doing this pondering, create rules for yourself regarding what differentiates a good source from a poor one. Compare your set of rules with those created by your team members. Then ponder again to see if you should, or should not, update your rule set to include ideas from their rule sets.

Finally pick at least five sources that according to your rules you would consider "good". List them and discuss what makes each of them worthwhile.


- In a Microsoft Word document, list your five resources, including links, and discuss what makes each of them worthwhile.

Google has become the number one resource for finding relevant information on just about any topic being searched.  That does not necessarily mean that all results are equal.  In sorting through the results finding reputable sources can be a matter of experience, but also finding information that is easy to read and understand.  Good sources present the material clearly, explain concepts in a way that's easy to understand, provide practical examples and exercises, and are up-to-date with current best practices and standards.  A good source is also likely to be written or produced by someone with a solid background in programming in general.

An iffy source may be outdated, confusing, or unreliable. It may lack clarity and present information in a disorganized way, or it may contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. An iffy source may also be produced by someone with limited knowledge or experience in JavaScript or programming in general.

When differentiating between reputable and iffy sources, it's important to consider the author of the source, the date of publication or last update, and the quality of the content. Reputable sources are often produced by recognized experts in the field, such as established software companies or respected programming educators. They are also likely to be up-to-date and regularly updated to reflect current best practices and standards.

In assessing the quality of the content being searched, it's helpful to look at user reviews and ratings, as well as any comments or feedback from others. This is one reason that the website StackOverflow has become so popular in the last several years.  Users are essentially crowd-sourcing the best answers.  It can also, be helpful to compare different sources and see if they present information in a consistent and coherent way. Finally, it's always a good idea to be critical of the material you're learning and to fact-check information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.

Here are a few of the sources that I use the most to help answer my development questions.

https://stackoverflow.com/

Stack Overflow is a question-and-answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers.  It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming.  It is an incredible collection of programming and software knowledge, that is constantly updated by users making it a very valuable resource.  When people start using Stack Overflow, they often don’t fully understand the purpose of the site. Stack Overflow is not a discussion site or a forum. It’s a knowledge base. That means for whatever questions are asked, any answer should be accurate, specific, and useful to the highest degree. It’s not a place to post partial answers or to ask questions on questions.  People are able to vote for the best answers which provide very accurate feedback on the value of the answers given.

When it comes to learning JavaScript, a good source is one that presents the material clearly, explains concepts in a way that's easy to understand, provides practical examples and exercises, and is up-to-date with current best practices and standards. A good source is also likely to be written or produced by someone with a solid background in JavaScript and programming in general.

On the other hand, an iffy source may be outdated, confusing, or unreliable. It may lack clarity and present information in a disorganized way, or it may contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. An iffy source may also be produced by someone with limited knowledge or experience in JavaScript or programming in general.

To differentiate between reputable and iffy sources, it's important to consider the author or publisher of the source, the date of publication or last update, and the quality of the content. Reputable sources are often produced by recognized experts in the field, such as established software companies or respected programming educators. They are also likely to be up-to-date and regularly updated to reflect current best practices and standards.

To assess the quality of the content, it's helpful to look at user reviews and ratings, as well as any comments or feedback from other learners. Additionally, it can be helpful to compare different sources and see if they present information in a consistent and coherent way.
