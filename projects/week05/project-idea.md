# Project Idea

My project idea is to build a geography game to test knowledge of the states and their locations.  This project would be a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The user would be presented with a map of the United States and given a prompt to click on the random state shown in the prompt.  The game would have a timer and keep track of guesses.

The project would make use of fetch to call an API for the maps and/or data used for the states.  The project would be made modular to help separate out functionality and data.

•	Display a map of the US for the user
•	Display prompt for the user
•	Display timer for the user
•	Display guess count for the user
•	Accept user input in the form of a click event on the map
•	Display results of user input correct/incorrect guess
